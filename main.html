	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm.'Time complexity' and 'efficient.'</p>
    <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely. Space Complexity' and 'O(n).'</p>
